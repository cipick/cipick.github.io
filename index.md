### Front-End Developer (Backbone and Marionette, Coffeescript) @ Kuende
**ian. 2015 – sept. 2016**
*București, România*

Front end development for the small social media platform, working alongside a team of designers, product owners and developers, in a really collaborative and fast paced environment.
We used model-view-controller architectural pattern. Backbone helped us out with the models and collections. Marionette is a framework based on Backbone which has views and collection views with very handy life-cycle methods. It also has a router linked to a controller so when a route is matched a method of the controller is executed. For persistence we used a RESTful API and we had to design the structure of the requests and responses. Because we wanted a clean code without parentheses, braces or semicolons we chose coffeescript and stylus and it was a pleasure to use them. We also had to concatenate all the files in a single file based on dependencies, we used Require.js with Gulp to build and deploy the app. We created a Node.js server with Express for development only, so we could test our APIs and the UI with Selenium and Intern.js.
